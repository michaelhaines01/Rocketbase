# Frontend Developer Coding challenge

 This app is built with React and displays cryptocurrencies based on the Coin Gecko API
 
 ## Features
  * Navbar includes a search input which gives you the ability to look up any coin.
  * Homepage features table of top 100 coins sorted by default in market cap size.
  * Homepage table has ability to filter or sort any column also change how many items are displayed per page. 
  * Trending page displays top 10 current coins traded by volume.
  * Ability to click on any coin via search bar or either of the tables to then see a more detailed page about the coin.
  * Tests written to check rendering of main components.
  * Responsive design across devices.

## Project notes
  * Search bar API only fetches 250 coins as the simple non paginated Coin Gecko API is currently down.
  * Home Page table only displays 100 coins as I used free version of Material UI Datagrid. 

## Built with
 * React
 * Sass
 * Material UI
 * Axios
